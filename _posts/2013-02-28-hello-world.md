title: Hello, World!

Welcome to the new blog! Blogger served a purpose for a while but I finally decided to go with something that gives me a bit more control and allows me to unify the blog and my codefolio. I really let the last blog slide but I'm determined to post here more frequently and more relevantly! I'm going to use the site as a platform for hosting new ideas and projects and for sharing my opinions and experiences; at least for myself if no-one else.

With all that in mind I have some objectives for my posts:
* Post at least once a month
* Share experiences and tutorials
* Always learn something (no angry rants that accomplish nothing)
* Do something useful

Clearly this post is the exception...
