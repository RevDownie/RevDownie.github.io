I stumbled across this great programming site last week called [CodinGame](http://www.codingame.com). It's basically a site full of fun programming challenges ranging from AI to maths to data structures.

One of the best things about the site is that it supports a whole bunch of languages including C++11, Scala, Java, Python and C# to name a few. This is brilliant as it allows you to implement solutions to the same problem in different languages and see which is fastest, shortest, simplest, etc. It also poses an added challenge of picking the right language for the problem.

I'm seriously toying of the idea of introducing it at work - perhaps picking a challenge a week and then getting the team together to discuss their implementations.

The only downside is that it's pretty addictive...
